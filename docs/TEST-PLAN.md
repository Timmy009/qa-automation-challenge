# QA Automation Test Plan

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the test plan for the QA Automation Challenge application, a full-stack application demonstrating comprehensive QA automation across UI, API, Performance, and Security layers. The goal is to ensure the application's functionality, reliability, performance, and security meet the defined requirements.

## 2. Scope

### In Scope

*   **User Authentication:** Registration, Login, Logout.
*   **Item Management (CRUD):** Create, Read, Update, Delete items.
*   **Frontend UI:** Responsiveness, user interaction, data display.
*   **Backend API:** Data validation, authentication, authorization, CRUD operations.
*   **Error Handling:** Proper display and logging of errors.
*   **Performance:** Load testing for key API endpoints.
*   **Security:** Basic vulnerability scanning.

### Out of Scope

*   Complex user roles/permissions beyond basic authentication.
*   Advanced search and filtering functionalities.
*   Real-time updates (e.g., WebSockets).
*   Extensive cross-browser compatibility testing (focus on modern browsers).
*   Detailed penetration testing (basic vulnerability scanning only).

## 3. Test Objectives

*   Verify all user authentication flows function correctly.
*   Ensure all CRUD operations for items are fully functional and secure.
*   Confirm the frontend UI is responsive and accurately reflects backend data.
*   Validate API endpoints handle requests and responses correctly, including error scenarios.
*   Assess the application's performance under load.
*   Identify common security vulnerabilities.

## 4. Test Strategy

A multi-layered testing approach will be employed:

### 4.1. Unit Testing (Developer-driven)

*   **Tools:** Jest (Frontend components, utility functions), Jest (Backend controllers, models, middleware).
*   **Focus:** Individual functions, components, and modules.
*   **Execution:** Part of the development workflow and CI/CD.

### 4.2. API Testing

*   **Tools:** Jest, Supertest.
*   **Focus:** Backend API endpoints, data validation, authentication, authorization, response structures.
*   **Methodology:** Black-box testing, sending HTTP requests and asserting responses.
*   **Execution:** Automated via CI/CD.

### 4.3. UI Testing

*   **Tools:** Cypress.
*   **Focus:** End-to-end user flows, critical paths, UI interactions, data display.
*   **Methodology:** Simulating user actions in a real browser environment.
*   **Execution:** Automated via CI/CD.

### 4.4. Performance Testing

*   **Tools:** k6.
*   **Focus:** API endpoint response times, throughput, and error rates under various load conditions.
*   **Methodology:** Load testing, stress testing (basic smoke test initially).
*   **Execution:** Manual or scheduled via CI/CD.

### 4.5. Security Testing

*   **Tools:** OWASP ZAP.
*   **Focus:** Identification of common web vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, SQL Injection, broken authentication).
*   **Methodology:** Automated active and passive scanning.
*   **Execution:** Manual or integrated into CI/CD.

## 5. Test Environment

*   **Frontend:** Next.js development server (`http://localhost:3000`)
*   **Backend:** Node.js/Express server (`http://localhost:5000`)
*   **Database:** MongoDB
*   **Operating System:** OS Agnostic (tested on macOS, Linux, Windows)
*   **Browsers (UI Tests):** Chrome (default for Cypress), Firefox (optional)

## 6. Test Data Management

*   **Users:** Pre-defined test users for login/registration scenarios.
*   **Items:** Fixtures for creating, updating, and deleting items.
*   **API Tests:** JSON files for valid and invalid request bodies.

## 7. Entry and Exit Criteria

### Entry Criteria

*   All development environments are set up.
*   Backend and Frontend applications are runnable locally.
*   Unit tests are implemented for core functionalities.
*   Test data is prepared.

### Exit Criteria

*   All critical UI and API test cases pass (100% pass rate).
*   Performance tests meet defined thresholds (e.g., 95th percentile response time < 200ms).
*   Security scans identify no critical or high-severity vulnerabilities.
*   All known bugs are logged and prioritized.
*   Code coverage meets minimum requirements (e.g., >80% for critical modules).

## 8. Roles and Responsibilities

*   **Developers:** Implement unit tests, fix bugs, support QA.
*   **QA Engineers:** Design and implement API, UI, Performance, and Security tests; report bugs; maintain test suites.

## 9. Tools and Technologies

*   **Frontend:** React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
*   **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, JWT, bcryptjs
*   **UI Automation:** Cypress
*   **API Automation:** Jest, Supertest
*   **Performance Testing:** k6
*   **Security Testing:** OWASP ZAP
*   **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions

## 10. Reporting

*   Test results will be available in the CI/CD pipeline logs.
*   Cypress and Jest generate detailed reports.
*   k6 generates console output and can be configured for JSON/HTML reports.
*   ZAP generates HTML/JSON reports.
*   Defects will be tracked in `docs/DEFECTS.md`.

## 11. Risks and Contingencies

*   **Risk:** Environment setup issues.
    *   **Contingency:** Provide clear, detailed setup instructions and troubleshooting guides.
*   **Risk:** Flaky UI tests.
    *   **Contingency:** Implement robust waits, retries, and isolated test environments.
*   **Risk:** Performance bottlenecks.
    *   **Contingency:** Identify bottlenecks using profiling tools and optimize code/database queries.
*   **Risk:** New vulnerabilities introduced.
    *   **Contingency:** Regular security scans and adherence to secure coding practices.
